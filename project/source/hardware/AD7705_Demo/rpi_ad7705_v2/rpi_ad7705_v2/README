This is an extension board which adds two analogue inputs to the Raspberry PI.
Three GPIO pins are also forwarded to another pin header with additional
input protection.

The AD7705 is a high preceision sigma delta converter with differential
inputs, buffers and a PGA. It's especially designed to measure small voltages,
for example from a pressure gauge or a thermocpuple.

The maximum sampling rate is 500Hz.

Board size: 39.37 x 51.44mm
