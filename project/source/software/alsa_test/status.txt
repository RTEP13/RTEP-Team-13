For sa.c (spectrum analyser):

To compile:
	gcc sa.c -o spec -lasound -lfftw3 -lm

What can it do:
	takes audio in from a microphone
	generates real and imaginary parts of N sized fft
	generates average value of buffer for levels info
	writes fft data to .csv file
	
still to do:
	streamline fft process, ensure is giving correct results

code structure:
	loop {
		read samples in
		get average amplitude value of samples coming in
		store samples to fft input buffer
	}
	fft from buffer
	get fft values
